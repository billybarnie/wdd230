        <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
        <section class="card">
            <p>The challenge that we all face in the economy today is mostly finding a job and also keeping a job as we all want to find things that we enjoy. 
            With the Irving Chamber of Commerce our mission has been to bring local businesses together in an effort to help find availability for workers eager 
            to make a difference in business. It is an open networking ground for local business leaders and citizens to find work or learn from one another. </p>

            <p>One of the other purposes for this site is to help local businesses with marketing assistance to ease the work load of going door to door or self marketing 
            through other outlets.</p>
        </section>
        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <section class="card">
            <p>One thing that we have been asked by a visitor has been what is the cost of signing up for the Irving Chamber of Commerce? When asked 
                this is what we had to say "We specifically lower costs of members joining to create a larger community in the area as well as making it 
                easier to network."
            </p>
            <p>
                Another thing that has been on some visitors mind is what the next months events are going to look like? Well We have 2 events going on next month, which we 
                do every October and that is, He have a business to business networking event so that a lot of businesses can learn from eachother and grow with each other.
            </p>
            <p>
                and last but not least we have been asked how persons can get into contact with the board of directors? You can reach out to the board of 
                directors online by going to the directors tab.
