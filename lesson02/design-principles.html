            <h3>Hicks Law</h3>
            <h4>Polygon</h4>
            <a href="https://hellopolygon.com/" target="_blank">hellopolygon.com</a>
            <img src="images/polygon-photo.png" alt="photo design of hicks law">
            <p>
                The point of the design principle behind Polygon is to simplify decision making for 
                persons that might or might not have ADHD to make it easier to decide if this works for them.
                Everything is kind of bunched together into a simple 3 step sign on process making little to no 
                imagination of how to sign on to help peoples with ADHD as well as other disorders which can be seen on the home page. Now the menus are also organized as well 
                in such way that hick's law is being used nearly perfectly, as you can see in the above screenshot. As Hick's law dictates a simplification decision making and keeping 
                things as simple as possible. In this case for the users and other around them.

            <h3>Rule of Thirds</h3>
            <h4>National Geographic</h4>
            <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/yom-kippur-history-traditions" target="_blank">nationalgeographic.com</a>
            <img src="images/national-geographic-photo.png" alt="photo of rules of third price menu filter">
            <p>
                With the vertical and horitzontal point you can see that the animal is the focal point of The Rules of Third rule being that he is in the center of the two yellow lines 
                to even give a further depth of where it should and does belong. There is also enough white space on either side so that you can further tell that they are using The Rule of Thirds rule.
                The idea behind The Rule of Thirds rule is to break a photo down into 3 equal columns and rows the from there find a good focal point and make sure that the focal point matches 
                up with what the photographer or artist, etc, is trying to capture.

            <h3>Fitt's Law</h3>
            <h4>Google Store</h4>
            <a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_learning_thermostat_3rd_gen?hl=en-US">store.google.com</a>
            <img src="images/nest-thermostat.png" alt="picture of a nest thermostat">
            <p>
                The Nest learning thermostat as seen in the photo above accurately uses the Fitt's Law as a way to show the order of importance of items in the menu in the form of a pie chart in a sense. 
                The menu of the Nest learning thermostat also have this pie chart, where the focal point of what it's trying to do is being achieved by letting you know the tempurature of the house. 
                Then in the sides in the menu will show you other things like the heating, cooling, and other things of that nature. You can also see that in the photo there is a leaf under the tempurature of the house in this case.
                That leaf next to the tempurature shows you that Fitt's law is accurately being used.
